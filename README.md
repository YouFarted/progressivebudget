# special thanks to Jake Achibald's idb, a promise based wrapper around the 
# atrocious API for indexedDB.
# https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb
# I wouldn't stomach the direct use of IndexedDB on production projects and # I won't do so here.
# also, thanks to the one-size-fits-all one-stop-shop tutorial at
# https://hackernoon.com/use-indexeddb-with-idb-a-1kb-library-that-makes-it-easy-8p1f3yqq

# It not only helped teaching how to use idb, but it also strengthened my 
# resolve to avoid using IndexedDB directly with a false hope that it may
# become less distasteful with more experience.
